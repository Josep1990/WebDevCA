Hello John,

Here are my links to the github repo and gitpod workspace

GitHub: https://github.com/Josep1990/WebDevCA

GitPod: https://4000-e7d9dc8b-9745-4175-834f-4fbfe275db79.ws-eu01.gitpod.io/


My website design was based on the single pages website with different sections instead of multiple pages, but owrk the same as any other websites
I you will see the links to the sections as you would see the links to the other pages in others website.
Thank you and I hope you like it.
